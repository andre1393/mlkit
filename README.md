# Python algorithms
In this project I develop some machine learning algorithms from scratch using python. These algorithms implementations are not meant to be faster or better than the existing ones, but to be easy to understand and help the ones that are learning and think that understand how the algorithms works is important.

Machine Learning algorithms implemented:
* classification:
  - decision_tree
  - naive_bayes
